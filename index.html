<p>When considering Public Archaeology, and how increasingly digital it is becoming, visualisation is starting to play a key role in how research and data are understood and presented. Just as Public Archaeology takes a variety of forms for various purposes, there are also many ways in which visualisation can be implemented and incorporated into a new or existing project.</p>

<p>As an example of how visualisation can be applied to an existing project, the infographic below takes the information from the main page of "Public Archaeology" and presents it in a new way that incorporates more images, icons, and designs that may present the information in a more appealing, eye-catching, and streamlined way.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the point?</h3>

<p>Public Archaeology has three main components:
  <ul>
      </ul>

      <li><strong>Preservation</strong>
      <p>Public Archaeology often brings attention to culturally or historically significant sites in order to raise awareness and encourage preservation. Public Archaeology allows archaeologists to reach a broad audience and encourage opportunities for the public to participate in preservation, whether through donations or simply visiting and promoting the site.</p><li>
     
      <strong>Education</strong>
      <p>Just as Public Archaeology is utilized for preservation, education is also an influential concern when designing and presenting archaeological information to the public. Whether implemented for preservation or simply for contribution to society’s knowledge, education is a central dimension of Public Archaeology.</p>

      <li><strong>Engagement</strong>
      <p>While education and preservation are two key aspects of Public Archaeology, it is only through engagement that either of these goals can be accomplished. In addition, by allowing the material to speak for itself and engage the public without any specific goal of education or preservation, people are able to explore and interact with the site in their own unique ways and draw new conclusions that may have been missed if the site was designed with a narrow, specific objective.</li>

      <p>Overall, the distinctions between these three components often become blurred when exploring Public Archaeology, but it is important to acknowledge the role each has in shaping the design, presentation, and reception of the data.</p>
